## Tech Stack

The application is built using a modern frontend tech stack:

-   **React 19** - UI library for building component-based interfaces
-   **TypeScript** - For type-safe code and better developer experience
-   **Vite** - Next-generation frontend build tool for faster development and optimized production builds
-   **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
-   **Framer Motion** - Animation library for creating fluid UI transitions and interactions
-   **shadcn/ui** - Accessible and customizable UI components built on Radix UI primitives
-   **Embla Carousel** - Lightweight carousel component for image galleries and content sliders

## Project Structure

The application follows a component-based architecture with a clean separation of concerns:

-   Typography using the Inter font family
-   Component variants for buttons, cards, and other UI elements
-   Custom animations for enhanced user experience

## Utilities

-   `scrollUtils.ts` - Helper functions for smooth scrolling behavior
-   `imageImports.ts` - Centralized image import management

## Performance Considerations

-   The application uses code splitting to optimize initial load times
